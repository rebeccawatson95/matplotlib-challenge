Being someone who loves research and science, this assignment was very helpful in helping me learn more about how data applies to my field. Sorting the data in this assignment was difficult at first. I knew what I wanted the end result to look like, but didn't realize how many steps needed to take place to get there. Through these steps, I found there was a better way to sort it than I originally had planned; randomly deleting data from a dataframe, is not the best way to go. 

When looking at the summary statistics, I noticed that there are two drugs which have a significant lower mean tumor volume. These two also have the lowest standard deviation and variance which could be significant in making a statement about the drugs' effectiveness. 

By looking at different charts of plotted data, it is easier to quickly identify if there is any bias in the dataset. The given set of data seems to have low bias when it comes to both gender and the number of mice tested with each drug. With these potential biases being about even across the board, it is fair to assume these are not factors in the results of our data. 

One last plot of significance is the scatter plot of weight versus average tumror volume. By looking at the chart of the drug "Capomulin", it is noted that as the weight of a mouse is higher, the average tumor volume is larger. This is confirmed by calculating the linear regression.
